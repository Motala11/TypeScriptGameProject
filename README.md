# TypeScriptGameProject

Welcome to my TypeScript project!:smiley:

In this project, I will be using TypeScript, along with HTML and SCSS/CSS to build a fully functioning web browser game.:video_game:

The game I have chosen to build is Tic-Tac-Toe (also known as noughts and crosses), as this was a staple of my childhood.

Please try the game and let me know how you get on!:fireworks:
